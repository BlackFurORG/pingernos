# Wanna help with translating? Heres the directions to translate!

<h6>PS: If the language isn't in discord's language list, it cannot be added</h6>

- You must fork this repo and create a folder in [this folder](/translations/) named the language then the region IF discord offers more then 1 region of the language, like "en-US" vs just "es"
- You must fill out all translations in the [translations_needed.json](/translations/translations_needed.json) and only change the value, not the key
- uhhh something else i forgot to add here
