## Reporting a Vulnerability

### What counts as a vulnerability?
Amongst other things, things that counts as a security vulnerability include, but are not limited to:
- vulnerabilities, bugs, glitches that threaten the privacy of our users
- vulnerabilities that might impact our database and stored user data
- vulnerabilities that might allow people to enter our systems
- vulnerabilities that might allow people to inject database queries or code

### How to report it
We ask you to report any and all vulnerabilities to us in one of the following ways:
- Sending a mail to [support@nightem.com](mailto:support@nightem.com)
- Creating a [security advisory](https://github.com/Nightem/pingernos/security/advisories/new)

... ***Do not report security vulnerabilities in discord, this is highly unsafe and will have consequences on your stay there.***
