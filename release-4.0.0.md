<h1 align="center">Release 4.0.0</h1>
<p align="center">
  Pingernos has long served as a status checker for Aternos servers, with the first commit being made on September 19th, 2021. This means that Pingernos is almost three years old.
  Unfortunately, the bot has been blocked out of the provider that Aternos uses for most servers through their DdoS protection. This means only a small scale of servers can still have their status checked at all times.
  <b>This means, pingernos will no longer serve as a status checker.</b>

<h2 align="center">What this means</h2>

> [!WARNING]
> The status command will still be available, but will only accept a very small portion of servers.


Pingernos has built a reliable and sizeable user- and guildbase, and we believe that shutting down Pingernos is not the solution.
We have talked the issue through with Aternos and understandably, they cannot and will not offer us a solution for this issue.
With that being said, we have decided to rework Pingernos into a multipurpose bot, supporting modules such as leveling, moderation, utility and economy.

These plans are not entirely concrete yet, but as we work on this we will keep our users updated [in our discord server](https://discord.gg/Z8KGvGWZcY).
As such, we also accept suggestions for features to implement into Pingernos as we build it into something new and functional. These can be given to us in the support-forum threads.


> [!CAUTION]
> You may find that the username and avatar of Pingernos will also change as we continue to build it into something new.
> You will hear it when this happens through our discord server.
